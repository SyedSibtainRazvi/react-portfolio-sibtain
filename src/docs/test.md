npm (Node Package Manager) is the standard package manager for Node.js, the most popular JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to set up and manage dependencies for both front-end and back-end applications.

Yarn, developed by Facebook, is another popular package manager. It provides faster and more reliable dependency management than npm. It handles complex dependency trees, resolves conflicts, and ensures that all dependencies work together.

pnpm is another package manager that has gained popularity in recent years. While not as popular as npm or Yarn, it has distinct benefits such as efficient storage consumption and increased stability.
